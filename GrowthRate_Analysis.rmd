#Rounding to calculate the day the photos were taken
dat2$SampleSession<-round(dat2$Seconds/(86400*3),digits=0)

```

#PROBLEM FIXING: average those with multiple photos taken on the same day by accident
On some sampling days, two pictures were taken of the same plant at once. This is bad because it leads to multiple images of the same plant on the same day. These will be taken care of here in the dat2 dataframe, by averaging the seconds and area measurements from the individual taken on the same day. 
```{r}
#Determine how many measurements there are per genotype.. and isolating those with more than 5 measurements. 
print("These are all of the genotypes with replicated images that need to be averaged")
dat2 %>% group_by(Genotype) %>% arrange(Seconds) %>% summarize(n=n()) %>% filter(n>5)

#This section will take the average of those errors. 
dat2<-dat2 %>% group_by(Genotype,SampleSession) %>% summarize(Seconds=mean(Seconds),area=mean(area),Family=first(Family),treatment=first(treatment))

#Must omit those with less than 5 measurements, because there simply wont be enough data to get any meaningful measurements from these. 
dat2 %>% group_by(Genotype) %>% arrange(Seconds) %>% summarize(n=n()) %>% filter(n<5)
#a|WSSWM3-1-0|Q|554,b|EFCC2-4-80|Q|145,"b|RULEB1-20|N|423" are not so bad, I suspect others are not as well, but for now i need to remove these genotypes, as they can bias the mean growth rates below.

Things of interest: 
**Initial**
1) intercept (how large the plant was initially, this could make the growth rate semm lower or faster)
**Growth**
2) Slope/Rate of Change to the max point. How long did it take to get there. 
3)Point of highest biomass.
**Decline Things**
4) Rate of decline/slope of decline. (How fast did the plant deteriorate)
5) Point of Decline (When did the plant start to deteriorate)
