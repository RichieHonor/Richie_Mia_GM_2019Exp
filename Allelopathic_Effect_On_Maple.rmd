#The question is, however, do glucosinolates significant reudce maple performance  because they are inhibiting maple (allelopathy) OR because those with high glucosinolate expression are better competitors and aquire more resources to then allocate more resources to defenes? (Chicken or the egg)

#Is the negative effect of glucosinolates on maple performance removed once Chlorophyll A expression is added to the model? This would control for garlic mustard performance becuase those that produce more chlorophyll can also produce more glucosinolates. 
fitTw3<-glmmTMB(Maple_TotalLeafArea_End~PC1Tot+MapleDamage+gluc_Conc+ChlorA,family = tweedie, data=MapleModel)
summary(fitTw3)
# Including Chlorophyll A completely removed the effect of glucosinolates. This suggests that glucosinolates may be correlated with maple performance due to plants that reudce maple performance having higher fitness and more resources for glucosinolates without glucosinolates actually being responsible. On the other hand, those with more glucosinolates may have higher fitness and be able to produce more Chlorophyll A because they are inhibiting maple.

vif(fitV) #Vif for ChlorA and gluc concentration are both below 2. This suggest that gluc_Conc and Chlor concentration are not high enough that the effect of the two are indistinguishable. This suggests that the entire effect of glucosinolates is due to chlorophyll concentration.

#Is there evidence that those in the maple and garlic mustard treatment have the same relationship between glucosinolate and chlorA? If glucosinolates are truly beneficial in one treatment but not in another, we might expect for the relationship between glucosinolates and ChlorA to be stronger in the treatment in which glucosinolates are beneficial. This is because if those that create more chlorophyll a passively allocate more resources to glucosinolates, this relationship may be a weaker relationship than if glucosinolates are increasing fitness and allowing an increased allocation to chlrophyll A.

#This demonstrates that the relationship between glucosinolate and chlorophyll is steeper in the treatments with competition. Therefore, there may be a benefit to producing glucosinolates in the competition treatments? Those with high glucosinolates in the maple treatment have higher chlorophyll levels than those with high glucosinolates in the alone treatment. In other words, those in the competition treatment have lower levels of chlorophyll at low levels of glucosinolates, and have higher level of chlorphyll at higher levels of glucosinolates. In other words (again) glucosinolates may be increasing performance in the competition treatments. 
```


#Effect of maple on GM performance. 
I chose to seperate this model from the last due to the causality inherent in this data. Glucosinolate concentration should affect garlic mustard fitness only through effects on maple and pathogen abundance. Including glucosinolate concentration in a model with both of these variables to determien the effect of glucosinolates on fitness is actually determining how much glucosinolates affect fitness when these terms are controlled for, which should be not at all. Therefore multiple models are needed to test if glucosinolates influence abundance of pathogens and maple performance, after controlling for garlic mustard performance (Using chlorophyll A, because those with high performance might simply be making more glucosinolates). Then i can see how much maple and pathogens influence garlic mustard performance.
