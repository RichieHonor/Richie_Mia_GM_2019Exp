#Is there evidence that those in the maple and garlic mustard treatment have the same relationship between glucosinolate and chlorA? If glucosinolates are truly beneficial in one treatment but not in another, we might expect for the relationship between glucosinolates and ChlorA to be stronger in the treatment in which glucosinolates are beneficial. This is because if those that create more chlorophyll a passively allocate more resources to glucosinolates, this relationship may be a weaker relationship than if glucosinolates are increasing fitness and allowing an increased allocation to chlrophyll A.

#This demonstrates that the relationship between glucosinolate and chlorophyll is steeper in the treatments with competition. Therefore, there may be a benefit to producing glucosinolates in the competition treatments? Those with high glucosinolates in the maple treatment have higher chlorophyll levels than those with high glucosinolates in the alone treatment. In other words, those in the competition treatment have lower levels of chlorophyll at low levels of glucosinolates, and have higher level of chlorphyll at higher levels of glucosinolates. In other words (again) glucosinolates may be increasing performance in the competition treatments.

#Effect of maple on GM performance. 
I chose to seperate this model from the last due to the causality inherent in this data. Glucosinolate concentration should affect garlic mustard fitness only through effects on maple and pathogen abundance. Including glucosinolate concentration in a model with both of these variables to determien the effect of glucosinolates on fitness is actually determining how much glucosinolates affect fitness when these terms are controlled for, which should be not at all. Therefore multiple models are needed to test if glucosinolates influence abundance of pathogens and maple performance, after controlling for garlic mustard performance (Using chlorophyll A, because those with high performance might simply be making more glucosinolates). Then i can see how much maple and pathogens influence garlic mustard performance.

I use the log(black path dam) but i do not have it weighted by leaf size. This is because i need to control for the influence that leaf size has on glucoisnolate concentration to avoid the autocorrelation between leaf size and performace (total leaf area)

If maples took hold at the end, it would explain why there is less glucosnilates in the treatment than expected, but total leaf area is just as high. This is consistent with the growth rate data and the fact that these were transplant maples
