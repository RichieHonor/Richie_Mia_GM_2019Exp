title: "Growth Rate Analysis"
output: html_notebook
---

This document is to compile the various measurements I have taken, for all genotypes in the competition experiment. The data from the fertilizer experiement is also included in this data set, but is properly integrated with the data pertaining to the fertilizer experiment in the document "FertilizerSynthesis.csv".

*Done*
###File for *initial size of GM and Maples, greenhouse location, treatment and competition number*: **"Data_collection_GH.csv"**. In R/masters_thesis

*Done*
###File for *germination transplant date, and gibberelic acid treatment*. **clean_germination_data_2.csv**. In R/masters_thesis.

*Done*
###File for *final manual measurement of maple size* **Maple_data.txt**. in Python/Raw_Data.

*Done*
###File for *final manual measurement of Alliaria leaf size* **Leaf_data.txt**. in Python/Final_GM_Data_CompetitionExp.

###File for *Growth Rate of Alliaria* **All_photo_data.txt**. in Python/python_pics_analysis.

*Done*
###File for *fern abundance and moss presence* **fern_cover.txt**. in Raw_Data. 

Note for analysis: 
only record as dead if I have the barcode, because some lost the barcode but did not die. Also, ferns were recorded for only one genotype if they were in the competition treatment, but it applied to both plants in the compeition treatment. 

*Done*
###File for *Pathogen damage* 

*Done*
###File for *Glocosinolate,Flavonoid and Chlorophyll content* **All_UV_Data.txt**. in masters_thesis/UVSpec

--------------------
--Goal of Analysis is to combine the documents into one master document that can be used to look at the data while considering all variables.

Removing Runs from dec 8 and 9. These runs were performed before the evaporation step was integrated into the protocol. Also, glucosinolate and flavonoid data from Jan 30 PM, Jan 31 AM and Jan 31 PM will be removed. These runs were performed on a different plate as the old plate was becomming quite stained. These runs had very low pools with much more variance, and thus the glucosinolate and flavonoid values need to be removed as the data is not reliable.The chlorophyll data for these runs is, however, okay because the chlorophyll samples were performed on the same plate. In Mabels run on feb 3 2020 AM, she added twice the amount of stain by mistake.(I.e. final samples were 300ul instead of 200, beause she added 100ul of CHCOOH and ALCL3 instead of 50ul of each). For this reason flavonoids will be removed from this run.
